# Binary Search Algorithm.
1. Sort the list.
2. Find the middle index.
3. Check the value a the middle index; if it's the value we're looking for return True.
4. Check the value a the middle index; if it's greater than the value we're looking for, cut off the right half of the list.
5. Check the value a the middle index; if it's less than the value we're looking for, cut off the left half of the list.
6. Repeat steps 2 through 6 until the list is empty.
if the while loops ends, it means there's no items left, so return False.
